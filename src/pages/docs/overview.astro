	<h2 id="show-all-settings">Show all settings</h2>

	<p>
		Bonjourr has lots of options. In an attempt to not be jarring for newcomers, we decided to
		hide most of them by default. If you're an advanced user, you can enable all those options
		by toggling <i>Show all settings</i> at the very top of the settings menu.
	</p>

	<h2 id="hide-settings-icon">Hide settings icon</h2>

	<p>
		When selecting the "Hide settings icon", the icon is still clickable at the same position as
		before. You can also open the settings menu by pressing the <code>Escape</code> key.
	</p>

	<h2 id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h2>

	<p>
		Bonjourr uses the <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers">Unsplash API</a> to fetch its backgrounds.
		We select them manually and store them in four different collections that change according to
		the time of the day:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://unsplash.com/collections/4933370/bonjourr-backgrounds-(day)"
				>During the day</a
			> or
			<a href="https://unsplash.com/collections/VI5sx2SDQUg/bonjourr-backgrounds-(night)"
				>at night</a
			>
		</li>
		<li>
			2 hours around <a
				href="https://unsplash.com/collections/yDjgRh1iqkQ/bonjourr-backgrounds-(noon)"
				>sunrise (Noon)</a
			> or
			<a href="https://unsplash.com/collections/2nVzlQADDIE/bonjourr-backgrounds-(evening)"
				>sunset (Evening)</a
			>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="unslpash-collection">Custom Unsplash collection</h3>

	<p>
		You can make your own collection of images using <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a
		>. To do so, you'll need to create an Unsplash account and add all your images to a new
		collection. Once you're pleased with your selection, you need the collection's ID present in
		its URL. You will spot it easily since it's the string of random letters and numbers. For
		example, if your collection's URL is <code
			>https://unsplash.com/collections/2170139/wolfdogs-of-unsplash</code
		>, the ID is <code>2170139</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Head back to Bonjourr and paste the ID in the <i>Unsplash collection</i> field. You can add multiple
		collections by separating them with a comma.
	</p>

	<h3 id="local-backgrounds">Local files</h3>

	<p>
		Switch your background type from Dynamic to Custom, and you'll be able to drag and drop your
		own images from your computer to Bonjourr.
	</p>

	<h2 id="links">Quick Links</h2>

	<p>
		You can add and import Quick Links from the settings, and edit them when you right click on
		them.
	</p>

	<p>
		An easy way to add a custom icon to your Quick Link is to upload it on somewhere like Imgur,
		and use that link as an icon. You can also convert your icon to a Data URI (max 8kB).
	</p>

	<p>
		⚠️ <i>Notice</i>: as a security measure, local paths like <code>file://</code>, browser
		settings links like <code>about:config</code> or <code>chrome://extensions</code> can't be added.
		However, <code>localhost:</code> links will work just fine.
	</p>

	<h3 id="folders">Link folders</h3>

	<p>
		Links folders are pretty cool. You can drag and drop them. Dragging a folder on another will
		add the content of the dragged folder in the target. Deleting a folder with links inside
		will also delete those links.
	</p>

	<h3 id="link-groups">Link pages</h3>

	<p>
		You can organize your links even more with link pages. To add a page, right click next to
		the default page. You cannot remove the default page, you can rename it. Deleting a page
		will remove the links inside.
	</p>

	<h2 id="searchbar">Search bar</h2>

	<p>
		When enabling the custom search engine option, the searchbar becomes compatible with all
		search engines, which includes things like YouTube
		(`https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%s`).
	</p>

	<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

	<p>
		Notes uses Markdown to create titles, lists, and checkboxes. To transform a line, just add
		these characters at the start of a line:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><code>#</code> big heading</li>
		<li><code>##</code> medium heading</li>
		<li><code>###</code> small heading</li>

		<li><code>-</code> classic list</li>
		<li><code>[ ]</code> checkbox</li>
		<li><code>[x]</code> checkbox, checked</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Other Markdown features, like italics, are not available currently.</p>

	<h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2>

	<p>
		Bonjourr gets its fonts from Fontsource. If you want to see previews of the fonts Bonjourr
		offers, please visit <a href="https://fontsource.com/">fontsource</a>.
	</p>

	<h2 id="page-layouts">Page layouts</h2>

	<p>
		There are 3 different page layouts to choose from: single, double and triple column. Each
		layout saves the position and alignment of your widgets independently.
	</p>

	<p>These options only affect the current layout:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Widget toggle (Enable switches)</li>
		<li>All options in grid toolbox</li>
		<li>Reset layout</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="settings-managment">Settings management</h2>

	<p>
		Bonjourr allows you to export all your settings into a file. You can use this feature if you
		want to save them or share them to someone. You will in turn be able to import said settings
		into any instance of Bonjourr.
	</p>

	<p>
		To do so, simply go to the bottom of your settings pannel, then click Export as file in the
		settings management. Your file will be downloaded. On your other instance of Bonjourr, you
		can then go to the Import tab of the settings management and drop your file. Bonjourr will
		reload and all your settings will be applied.
	</p>

	<h3>Browser syncing</h3>

	<p>
		Bonjourr is compatible with the automatic syncing features of both
		<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/sync/">Firefox</a>
		and <a
			href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277?hl=fr&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop"
			>Chrome</a
		>. If you log into your Mozilla/Google account on your browser and have syncing enabled in
		your browser, Bonjourr should get synced to other instances of the same browser on other
		computers. This is true for all Bonjourr settings as well as Quick Links.
	</p>
